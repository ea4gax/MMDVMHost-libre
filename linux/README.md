Linux Daemon Startup Scripts
============================

In the subfolders here you will find start scripts for running MMDVMHost as a daemon on Linux systems using either  
systemd or init for their boot.

In both cases the scripts are fully functional providing the usual start / stop / status etc.

These have been writting specifically for Raspbian Wheezy (init) and Rasbian Jessie (systemd) although there is  
no reason that they shouldnt work on many other distributions.
