To use DMR Access Control you can add the following fields to your MMDVM.ini:

Blacklist= <comma separated list of source-id's to block on RF>
DstIdBlackListSlot1RF= <comma separated list TGs to block on RF Slot1>
DstIdBlackListSlot2RF= <comma separated list TGs to block on RF Slot2>
DstIdWhiteListSlot1RF= <comma separated list TGs to allow on RF Slot1> 
DstIdWhiteListSlot2RF= <comma separated list TGs to allow on RF Slot2>
DstIdBlackListSlot1NET= <comma separated list TGs to block on NET Slot1>
DstIdBlackListSlot2NET= <comma separated list TGs to block on NET Slot2>
DstIdWhiteListSlot1NET= <comma separated list TGs to allow on NET Slot1> 
DstIdWhiteListSlot2NET= <comma separated list TGs to allow on NET Slot2>

So, for example:

DstIdBlackListSlot1=91 - block the TG91 net.

DstIdWhiteListSlot1=9.5057,9990 - allows TG9, APRS SMS Gateway and Echo. 

If the whitelist is null and commented out, it is disabled. 

The whitelist behaves slightly differently on Slot1 than is does on Slot2.

For Slot1, the whitelist will allow all IDs above 99999 and everything in the whitelist.

For Slot2, the whitelist will allow all IDs between 4000 and 5000, IDs above 99999 and everything in the whitelist. 

You can use the blacklist with the whitelist if you want to specifically block IDs within the allowed ranges above. 

For example, to block users from disconnecting the reflectors, you could block ID 4000.

To block users connecting to reflector 4400 you could add ID 4400 to the network blacklist for that slot.
